# CoordinatorBehaviors


## What is it?
For now, this is a C# port of the [CoordinatorBehaviorExample](https://github.com/saulmm/CoordinatorBehaviorExample) by [Saúl Molinero](https://github.com/saulmm),
a little Behavior and Animator that helps you create an Avatar to Image transition in a Toolbar.

Later on, I intend to add more custom animatios that I can find or implement.

## MinSDK version

I used the latest Support libraries from Xamarin, I believe it's KitKat (API 19).

## How?

You use the library by setting a view dependency for the coordinator in the Layout.
This normally is an ImageView. Later I'll add an example.
